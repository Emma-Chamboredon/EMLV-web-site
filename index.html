<p> For those who have never been there, let me give you a piece of geography to locate it, as well as history. And then my best memories and recommandation. </p>

<h1> Practical information</h1>

<h2> Geography</h2>

<p> Jericoacoara is located 320 km from Fortaleza in the southeast and too many hours of travel from São Luis in the northwest. It has resisted the sometimes unbridled development of tourism however ecological it may be. </p>

<p>It is nestled in a pretty little bay on the west coast on the road to the setting sun and has a semi-arid climate. <p>

<h2>Piece of history</h2>

<p>The bay where Jericoacoara beach is located is naturally protected by a hill and its surrounding dunes form a true natural barrier. The dunes are omnipresent and shape the landscape as much as they influence the atmosphere of this village, similarly to those of the Lençóis Maranhenses Park.<p/>

<p>As soon as the Brazilian government classified this micro-region as an “Environmental Protection Zone” in 1984, all eyes naturally turned to it. The following year, the small fishing village lurking between the dunes could no longer hide. Dunes, green hills, gently sloping beaches, ocean, summer temperatures all year round… All of which is protected by the Brazilian State.<p/>

 

<h1> A world class spot</h1>

<h2> Natural pleasures of nature</h2>

<p>Jericoacoara: a place where water sports, tranquility, clear and fresh water, incredible discoveries, hospitality and shows of nature are combined.</p>

<p>Surfing is a popular past time in "Jeri". The best spot for smaller, calm waves, which are ideal for beginners and longboarders. </p>

<h2>My opinion</h2>

<p>I particulary recommend Jericaocoara as a relaxing stopover in a dynamic and active journet, where you will both enjoy higt surfing spot, as well as very peacefull nature paradise. For bigger waves, more suitable for shortboard and more advanced surfers I recommend Malhada beach.</p>

<p>The best time of year for surfing is between December and April when the waves get bigger and the wind is lighter.</p>
